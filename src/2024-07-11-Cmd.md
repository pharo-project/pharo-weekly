## Cmd Line Launcher

Hi all,

Pharo Launcher 3.2 has just been released! It is available from ![http://pharo.org/download](http://pharo.org/download).

Pharo Launcher now comes with a command-line version that you can use from a terminal!
You can check the documentation of commands at ![https://pharo-project.github.io/pharo-launcher/commands-cmd-line/](https://pharo-project.github.io/pharo-launcher/commands-cmd-line/) as well as instructions to make pharo-launcher available on command line: ![https://pharo-project.github.io/pharo-launcher/installation/](https://pharo-project.github.io/pharo-launcher/installation/).

This nice feature is now available thanks to the contributions of Axel Marlard, David Bajger, and I as well as the support of Damien Pollet for the Clap library.

## New features:

Command Line support

- all commands available in the UI version of Pharo Launcher are supported
new commands
- create an image from a Pull Request number (from Pharo repository)
- create an image from a build number, a SHA
- create an image and import your code from a repository
- share easily an image (zip file with the Pharo image, the VM to run it and a launch script)
- find easily the Pharo version where a bug was introduced with image bisect algorithm
- launch an image with a script
- list running Pharo processes

When creating an image, the image is now launched automatically.
The CI moved to Github Actions

## Improvements:

- Better Mac Os system menu
- Do not try to guess anymore the version of a Pharo image if information not available but rather ask the user
- When deleting more than 1 image at a time the message is not clear #594

## Bug fixes:

- Pharo 12.0 build list incomplete #667
- Use "Show" when no image is downloaded yet gives error #570 (thanks to @astares)
- Development mode does not close pharoLauncher application #548
- Using "Show in folder" gives DNU #568 (thanks to @astares)
- Launcher cannot launch Pharo-4.0 image #585

The Pharo team.
