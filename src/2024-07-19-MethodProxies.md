## Method proxies

Hello,

As presented at ESUG, we have released the new version of MethodProxies for Pharo 12 and 13.
MethodProxies is a library that allows to control message-passing to instrument any method in the system to execute an action before and after a method's execution. We worked a lot on this new version to optimize it to have a low overhead.
We have also a release for Pharo11 and less but that version does not have our optimizations, but you can use it without any problem. If you really need Pharo 11 and want to use the new fast and optimized version, you can contact me.

You can find it here: https://github.com/pharo-contributions/MethodProxies

Cheers,
Sebastian Jordan
